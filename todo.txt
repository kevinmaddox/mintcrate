- MintCrate --------------------------------------------------------------------
[x] General input
[x] Music
[x] SFX
[x] Destroying entities
[x] Rearranging entity order
[x] Mouse input
[x] Change MathX name to mathEx or something
[x] Fix window rescaling thingy
[x] Fix tiled backdrop bug
[x] Fix collision map generation
[x] If room is smaller than client size, it should be placed in top-left corner
[x] Fullscreen mode
[x] Make sure all features are implemented
[x] Reorganize/comment all code
[x] Make it so behavior map can be omitted when loading a tilemap
[x] Music loop points for OGG
[x] Add functions for getting left/right/top/bottom/width/height of Active collider
[x] Return tile data when performing collision check
[x] Add @return statements to function comments
[x] Change resource paths to res/active, res/backdrop, etc. & store in vars
[x] Add function: setResourcePaths(pathActives, pathBackdrops, etc.)
[x] Room background color is different from window background color
[x] Graphical tearing at 1x & 3x scale (non-integral camera position issue?)
[x] Fix hitbox rectangle drawing
[x] Add debug info display for camera
[x] Add left/center/right alignment for Text elements (and to the draw text function)
[x] Functions for adding entities... make the extra things be optional params in tables
[x] Change the name of "Text" objects to "Paragraph"
[x] Make action points accept table values to have multiple points per a single animation
[x] Room fade transitions
[x] Option to fade out when quitting
[x] Engine setting to turn BGM/SFX on/off (and adjust volume, perhaps?)
[x] Bug - Sounds not stopping when changing rooms (stopAllSounds not working?)
[x] Option to fade or persist audio when fading out a room
[x] Add validation and error-checking to functions
  [x] Loader
  [x] Engine core
    [x] Main functions
    [x] Object-defining functions (defineActives, etc.)
    [x] Saving/loading data valiation
  [x] Room
  [x] Inputhandler
  [x] Entity
  [x] Active
  [x] Backdrop
  [x] Paragraph
  [x] MathX
  [x] Util
    [x] Main stuff
    [x] JSON encoder/decoder
  [x] Change Assert.Cond to Assert.Condition
  [x] Formatting
[x] Think really hard about function/class names
  [x] Get rid of toggles, make sure it's all where you have to set it to true/false
  [x] Paragraph probably should just be Text
  [x] engine.lua should be core.lua
[x] Dump/log utility
[x] Findings/issues
  [x] Remove pathPrefix from engine core constructor
  [x] Alter it so that tilemap calls aren't in Room but are instead in Engine core
  [x] Collisions still work on x,y point even if active lacks a collider; this should not happen
[x] Make everything nice and clean
[ ] Debug collision mask rectangle looks jumpy when moving
[ ] Testing
  [ ] Ensure that you can't break camera bounds... maybe add some extra conditional validation?
  [ ] Go through every class and try to break stuff
    [ ] Engine core
    [ ] Room
    [ ] Inputhandler
    [ ] Entity
    [ ] Active
    [ ] Backdrop
    [ ] Paragraph
    [ ] MathX
    [ ] Util
[ ] Reconsider fonts/text, and how it affects localizations
[ ] Long-term: Make the JSON parser handle more bad-JSON errors

Decisions
- none

For when Love 12 comes out
[ ] Implement <close> to auto run init() when Engine constructor finishes
